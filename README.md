# Atlanta 2-Year Crime Data Analysis Project
    
    ## 1. Project Overview
    Introduction to the Atlanta crime data project, outlining the goals and scope of analyzing crime trends over a two-year period in Atlanta.
    
    ## 2. Data Cleaning in Excel
    The initial dataset was cleaned and prepared using Microsoft Excel. This involved:
    - Standardizing data formats across various fields.
    - Handling missing values through imputation or removal based on context.
    - Performing data validation to ensure accuracy and consistency.
    
    ## 3. Data Analysis in SQL (BigQuery)
    The cleaned data was uploaded to Google BigQuery for in-depth analysis using SQL. Key analyses included:
    - Identifying crime trends over time.
    - Pinpointing crime hotspots within the city.
    - Generating statistical summaries of different crime categories.
    
    ## 4. Data Storytelling
    Insights derived from the SQL analysis were synthesized to form a narrative about crime in Atlanta. This involved connecting the dots between different findings and preparing to communicate them effectively.
    
    ## 5. Data Visualization with Tableau
    Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards from the analyzed data, allowing for an intuitive exploration of crime patterns and trends.
