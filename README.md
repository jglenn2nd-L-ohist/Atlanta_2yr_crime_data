# Atlanta 2-Year Crime Data Analysis
    
    This project analyzes crime data from Atlanta over a 2-year period. The workflow involves data cleaning using Excel and subsequent analysis using SQL.
    
    ## Project Workflow
    
    1.  **Data Sourcing & Initial State:**
        * The raw crime data was initially sourced in an Excel format.
        * The initial dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, or formatting issues (dirty data).
    
    2.  **Data Cleaning in Excel:**
        * Microsoft Excel was used to perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
        * Tasks included:
            * Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
            * Correcting data types.
            * Standardizing formats.
            * Removing duplicate entries.
            * Addressing inconsistencies.
    
    3.  **Data Import into SQL:**
        * The cleaned data from Excel was imported into Big Query for more robust analysis.
    
    4.  **Data Analysis and Storytelling with SQL:**
        * SQL queries were used to explore the data, identify trends, patterns, and generate insights related to crime in Atlanta.
        * Analysis focused on aspects such as crime types, locations, temporal trends, etc.
        * The results of the SQL queries form the basis of the data story presented.
